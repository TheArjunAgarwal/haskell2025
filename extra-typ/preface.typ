- Ryan Hota. This is his third
    year doing it, and at this point, 
    he could teach the course in his sleep. And sometimes does, due to 
    poor scheduling His research interest is Logic and Set Theory, which 
    is a fancy way of saying he enjoys pain. 
    He uses Windows out of what we can only assume is a deep and personal 
    vendetta against usability.

- Shubh Sharma should, at this 
    very moment, be writing his thesis. 
    Instead, he's co-authoring a textbook. His academic timeline is 
    nonlinear and possibly violates causality. He runs Linux, because of course 
    he does. Ask him a question and he’ll answer it in a shell script. 
    Nobody knows his actual research interests, including he himself.

- Arjun Maneesh Agarwal, the    most overconfident student to walk CMI’s 
    hallowed halls. He’s under the delusion that he can overhaul a
    course with nothing but ambition, caffeine, and opinions. 
    His research interests are Game Theory, Economics, and Statistics, 
    which explains why he thought he could outvote two people and make us use 
    LaTeX. We use Typst now. Take that, Arjun. Also, he uses MacOS because of course he does.

This book is our open letter to the future 
students of CU1101, and our way of making sure that, when the class is inevitably 
postponed again for an NBA final, you’ll at least have something to read.

Eventually, Prof. Suresh will probably write a real preface here. 
Something dignified. Academic. Wise. But until then, 
consider this the Haskell version of a Reddit shitpost—well-typed, 
lovingly chaotic, and just expressive enough to make you wonder if we’ve all gone mad. (We have.)

Enjoy.
